Done in September
===

<a name="payments-sep-18">Launched MDN payments</a>
---
We've been thinking about the direction and growth of MDN.  We'd like a more
direct connection with developers, and to provide them with valuable features
and benefits they need to be successful in their web projects. We've researched
several promising ideas, and decided that direct payments would be the first
experiment. Logged-in users and 1% of anonymous visitors see the
banner that asks them to directly support MDN. See Ali Spivak's and Kadir Topal's post,
[A New Way to Support MDN](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/a-new-way-to-support-mdn/),
for more information.

The implementation phase started in August, when
[Potato London](https://p.ota.to/) was hired to design and implement
payments.  Potato did an amazing job executing on a 5 week schedule, including
several design meetings, daily standups, and a trip from Bristol to London to
meet face-to-face during the MDN work week. Thanks to the hard work from the
Potato team, including Charlie Harding,
[Josh Jarvis](https://github.com/joshJarr),
[Matt Hall](https://github.com/matthewhall),
[Michał Macioszczyk](https://github.com/michal-macioszczyk),
Philip Lackmaker, and Rachel Lee.

 "Abakanowicz's \"Embryology\", showing at the Tate Modern near the Mozilla offices.")

Mozilla staff across the organization also helped keep this project on
schedule, from writing copy to security reviews to
[pull request reviews and fixes](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pulls?page=3&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed),
including Ali Spivak, Caglar Ulucenk, Diane Tate, Havi Hoffman,
[Kadir Topal](https://github.com/atopal),
Kevin Fann,
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone),
[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) and me.

<a name="a10y-sep-18">Improved MDN's accessibility resources</a>
---
After the work week, we met with accessibility experts for the Hack on MDN
event. Volunteers and staff improved MDN's coverage of accessibility. This
included discussions of accessibility topics, improving and expanding MDN's
documentation, and writing related blog posts. It also included code changes,
improving MDN's color contrast and adding markup for screen readers.
See Janet Swisher's 
[Hack on MDN: Better accessibility for MDN Web Docs](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/hack-on-mdn-better-accessibility-for-mdn-web-docs/)
for the details.

Seren Davies ([@ninjanails](https://twitter.com/ninjanails)) was there,
and many nails were painted.

<a name="workweek-sep-18">Removed 15% of KumaScript macros</a>
---
The MDN team got together for a week at the London office to reflect
on the quarter and plan the coming year.

We discussed KumaScript, our macro language and rendering service
that implements standardized sidebars, banners, and internal links. It's been
easier to analyze macros since we moved them to GitHub in
[November 2016](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.mdn/MJHUaWtF0mU/cKppYPz0CwAJ).
We're happy with the performance gains, but code reviews take forever, translations
are hard, and we're slow to write
[tests](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/tree/master/tests/macros).
These issues contributed to an incident in August where a sidebar macro was broken,
and all the API reference pages showed an error for a day
([bug 1487640](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487640)).

Staff is getting impatient with KumaScript, and wants to replace it with
something better. Florian wrote up the notes from the meeting on Discourse as
[Next steps for KumaScript](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/next-steps-for-kumascript/32227).

[Florian](https://github.com/Elchi3),
[Will Bamberg](https://github.com/wbamberg), and
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) started on the first step,
identifying and removing unused or seldom-used macros, such as
[hello.ejs](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/blob/8462c9db6da3b00f1dd84004609e03ad49e698c3/macros/hello.ejs).
([PR 849](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/849)).

![hello](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-10-hello.jpg
 "Lionel Richie getting the news his favorite macro is gone.")

The team removed
[72 macros](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A2018-09-01..2018-09-30+label%3A%22Macro+massacre%22)
in about 2 weeks, and will continue removing them for the rest of the year.
This will leave a 
[smaller number of important macros](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/macros),
and we can analyze them for the next steps in the project.

This includes some important changes and fixes:

- `EmbedLiveSample`: Avoid XSS, and add `allow=` parameter
  ([KumaScript PR 786](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/786)),
  from
  [me](https://github.com/jwhitlock). This and related PRs fix live samples,
  like
  [media constraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints#Result),
  that broke when Chrome and Safari began enforcing feature policies in an
  ``<iframe>``. See [Google's explainer page](https://goo.gl/EuHzyv),
  [Policy Controlled Features](https://github.com/WICG/feature-policy/blob/master/features.md),
  and [bug 1482159](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1482159).
- End compat tables beta
  ([KumaScript PR 860](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/860))
  from
  [Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3), and
  [Kuma PR 4988](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4988)
  from
  [Stephanie Hobson](https://github.com/stephaniehobson).
  With 96% of the data migrated, and more than 6,500 pages using the new
  layout, it was time to stop calling it a beta.
- First chunk of unittest fixes for Python 3
  ([Kuma PR 4910](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4910)),
  from
  [Anthony Maton](https://github.com/MatonAnthony). We plan to switching to
  Python 3 by the end of the year.
- Update `<div>` example to use CC0 image
  ([Interactive Examples PR 1088](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/1088)),
  from
  [Eric Shepherd](https://github.com/a2sheppy), a continuing project to get
  consistent licensing for the interactive examples repository.
- Add first iteration of console
  ([bob PR 129](https://github.com/mdn/bob/pull/129)),
  from
  [Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling), a new feature for
  WebAPI interactive examples to see the output of JavaScript code snippets.
- Remove certain contributions as part of relicensing plan
  ([Data PR 294](https://github.com/mdn/data/pull/294)), and
  Change repo license to CC0
  ([Data PR 301](https://github.com/mdn/data/pull/301)),
  from
  [Chris Mills](https://github.com/chrisdavidmills). This is part of a
  [4 month effort](https://github.com/mdn/data/issues/240)
  to change the license of the
  [mdn/data repo](https://github.com/mdn/data) and
  [mdn-data npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-data) to
  [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), to allow
  the data to be used in similar contexts as the
  [mdn-browser-compat-data npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data)
  and data.

Planned for October
===
October is the start of the fourth quarter. We have a few yearly goals to
complete, including the Python 3 transition, the next round of the payments
experiment, and performance experiments. This quarter also contains
major holidays and the
[Mozilla All Hands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/Orlando2018),
which mean it has about half the working days of other quarters. Time to get to
work!

<a name="servers-sep-18">Move to Mozilla IT infrastructure</a>
---
In October,
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone),
[Ed Lim](https://github.com/limed),
[Dave Parfitt](https://github.com/metadave),
and [Josh Mize](https://github.com/jgmize) will complete the setup
of MDN services in the Mozilla IT infrastructure, and switch production
traffic to the new systems. This will complete the migration of MDN from
Mozilla Marketing to Emerging Technologies, started in
[February 2018](https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2018/03/08/mdn-changelog/).
The team is organizing the switch-over checklist, and experimenting with the
parallel staging environments.

The production switch is planned for October 29th, and the site will be
available in read-only mode for a few hours during the transition.
