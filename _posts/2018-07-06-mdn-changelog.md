Done in June
===

Here's what happened in June to the
[code, data, and tools](https://github.com/mdn/)
that support
[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org):

- [Shipped 100+ HTML Interactive Examples](#html-ie-jun-18)
- [Shipped Django 1.11](#dj11-jun-18)
- [Shipped tweaks and fixes](#tweaks-jun-18)
  by merging 252 pull requests,
  including 32 pull requests
  from 26 new contributors.

Here's the plan for July:

- [Decommission Zones](#zones-jun-18)
- [Focus on Performance](#performance-jun-18)

<a name="html-ie-jun-18">Shipped 100+ HTML Interactive Examples</a>
---
In June, we shipped over 100 HTML interactive examples, adding quick
references and playgrounds for our HTML element documentation.

 "The figcaption interactive example.")

[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) fixed the remaining
blockers, such as applying an `output` class as a style target
([PR 961](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/961)),
and adding some additional size options
([PR 962](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/962)).
[wbamberg](https://github.com/wbamberg) wrote instructions for adding the
examples to MDN, and [SphinxKnight](https://github.com/SphinxKnight) and
[Irene Smith](https://github.com/irenesmith) pitched in to deploy them in
less than 24 hours. MDN visitors have fun, informative examples on JS, CSS,
and now HTML reference pages.

Irene Smith joined the MDN writer's team this month as a Firefox Developer
Content Manager. She started work right away, including helping with this
project. Welcome to the team, Irene!

<a name="dj11-jun-18">Shipped Django 1.11</a>
---
We deployed Django 1.11 on June 6th. There are no visible changes, but also
no errors for MDN visitors. Sometimes a engineering project is successful if
you just get back to where you started.

![falcon-heavy](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-07-falcon-heavy.jpg
 "Like the Falcon Rocket, MDN took a long journey to return where we started.")

We did most of the
[preparation work](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/06/media-mathml-and-django-1-11-mdn-changelog-for-may-2018/#django-1-11-may-18)
in development environments. On June 1st, we shipped Django 1.11 to our
staging environment
([PR 4830](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4830)). This exposed a few
issues that were quick to fix, such as the logging configuration
([PR 4831](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4831)) and client-side
translation catalogs ([PR 4831](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4831)).
Tests in the production-like staging environment ensured the last bugs
were fixed before MDN's visitors saw them.

We're looking ahead to the next framework update.  Django 1.11 is the last to
support Python 2.7, so we'll need to switch to
[Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498).
We've added a
[Python 3 build to TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/kuma),
and will ratchet up compatibility over time.
([PR 4848](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4848)).
[Anthony Maton](https://github.com/MatonAnthony) started the Python 3 changes
at the Mozilla All-Hands, updating tests to expect random dictionary order,
[a security feature enabled in Python 3.3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14959001/10612)
([PR 4851](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4851)). We expect many more
changes, and we plan to switch to Python 3 with Django 1.11 by the end of the
year.

The next Django Long-Term Support (LTS) release will be 2.2,
[scheduled for April 2019](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions).
The work will be similar to the last upgrade, updating the code to be
compatible with Django 1.11 through 2.2.
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) started the process by converting
to the
[new-style middleware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/middleware/),
required in 2.0
([PR 4841](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4841)). We plan a smooth
switch to Django 2.2 by June 2019.

Planned for July
===
July is the start of the second half of the year, and the team is thinking
about what can be done by the end of the year. We're planning on finishing
the compatibility data migration this year, and expanding interactive
examples to another documentation section.

<a name="zones-jun-18">Decommission Zones</a>
---
Zones are a wiki engine feature that moves a tree of pages to a different URL,
and applies additional CSS for those pages. Zones also add
complexity to every request, require additional testing, and are a frequent
source of bugs and translation problems. Zones have more enemies than fans on
the MDN staff.

We've been deprecating zones for a few years. We stopped using new zones as a
design tool. In 
[last year's site redesign](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/07/the-mdn-redesign-behind-the-scenes/),
we de-emphasized the style differences between zones and "standard" wiki
content
([PR 4348](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4348)).
When migrating MDN to a new data center, we added a
[redirects framework](https://github.com/pmac/django-redirect-urls) that can
elegantly handle the custom URLs. We're ready for the final steps.

At the Mozilla All-Hands,
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) and
[wbamberg](https://github.com/wbamberg) prepared to remove
zones. The work took the entire week.  On the engine side, custom URLs need
redirects to the standard wiki URLs, and some zone styles need to be
preserved
([PR 4853](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4853)).
Zone sidebars need to
be reimplemented as KumaScript sidebars, along with translations
([PR 711](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/711)).
Finally, content needs to be changed, to add the KumaScript sidebars and to use
standard wiki CSS. While the changes are large, the effect is subtle.

![progressive](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-07-progressive.png
 "The Progressive Web Apps documentation, with zones and without zones. For most pages, the visual change will be this subtle.")

After the work week, we reviewed and refined the code, double-checked the
changes, and clarified the plan. We'll ship the code, update the content,
and delete zones in July.

<a name="performance-jun-18">Focus on Performance</a>
---
We're wrapping up the performance audit of MDN in July. We've picked some key
performance metrics we'd like to track, and the headline metric is how long it
takes for the interactive example to be ready on CSS, JS, and HTML reference
pages.
[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) is implementing the
timing measurements
([IE PR 967](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/967),
[Kuma PR 4854](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4854), and others),
using the
[PerformanceTiming API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming)
so the measurements will be available in browser tools. We also track timing
in Google Analytics, to get real-user metrics from MDN's global audience,
unless the user has requested that
[we don't track them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT).

We've found several performance bottlenecks, and we're prioritizing them to pick
the quick wins and the high-impact changes. We'll ship improvements in July
and beyond.
