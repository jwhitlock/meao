title: MDN Changelog for March 2018
author: John Whitlock
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

**Editor's note:**
*A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changelog</a>
is "a log or record of all notable changes made to
a project. [It] usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new
features, etc." Publishing a changelog is kind of a tradition in open source,
and a long-time practice on the web. We thought readers of Hacks and folks who
use and contribute to 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>
would be interested in learning more about the work of the MDN engineering
team, and the impact they have in a given month. We'll also introduce code
contribution opportunities, interesting projects, and new ways to participate.*

Here's what happened in March to the
[code, data, and tools](https://github.com/mdn/)
that support
[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org):

- [Improved compatibility data at the Hack on MDN event](#bcd-mar-18)
- [Experimented with brotli compression](#brotli-mar-18)
- [Shipped tweaks and fixes](#tweaks-mar-18)
  by merging 370 pull requests,
  including 137 pull requests
  from 48 new contributors.

Here's the plan for April:

- [Get HTML interactive examples ready for production](#ie-mar-18)
- [Ship the CDN and Django 1.11](#cdn-mar-18)
- [Improve the Front End Developer Experience](#frontend-mar-18)

<a name="bcd-mar-18">Improved compatibility data at the Hack on MDN event</a>
---
In March, the MDN team focused on the Browser Compatibility Data project,
meeting in Paris with dozens of collaborators for the "Hack on MDN" event. The
work resulted in
[221 Pull Requests in the BCD repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22HackOnMDNParis2018+%3Afr%3A%22+),
as well as additional work in other repos. See
Jean-Yves Perrier's
[Hack on MDN article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/hack-on-mdn-building-useful-tools-with-browser-compatibility-data/)
for details about the tools created and data updated during the week.

We reviewed and merged over 250 PRs in March. The compatibility data conversion
jumped from 57% to 63% complete.
[Jeremie Patonnier](https://github.com/JeremiePat) led the effort to convert
SVG data ([BCD PR 1371](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/1371)).
API data was also a focus, both converting the existing MDN tables and using
other data sources to fill out missing APIs.

There's now
[264 open PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr)
in the BCD repo, about a month's worth, and the contributions keep coming in.
BCD is one of the most active GitHub repositories at Mozilla this year by pull
requests (880) and by authors (95), only second to
[rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) (1268 PRs, 267 authors).
The rate of contributions continue to increase, so BCD may be #1 for Q2 2018.

<a name="brotli-mar-18">Experimented with brotli compression</a>
---
[Brotli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli) is a Google-developed
compression algorithm designed for serving web assets, which can outperform the
widely used [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) algorithm. By the end
of 2017, all major browsers support the <code>br</code>
content-encoding method, and Florian requested a test of brotli on MDN in
[bug 1412891](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412891).
[Maton Anthony](https://github.com/MatonAnthony) wrote a Python-2 compatible
brotli middleware in [PR 4686](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4686),
with the default compression level of 11. This went live on March 7.

Brotli does compress our content better than gzip. The homepage goes from 36k
uncompressed to 9.5k with gzip to 7k with brotli.  The results are better on
wiki pages like [CSS display
page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), which goes
from 144k uncompressed to 20k with gzip and 15k with brotli.

However, brotli was a net-negative for MDN performance. Average response time
measured at the server was slower, going from 75 ms to 120 ms, due to the
increased load of the middleware. Google Analytics showed a 6% improvement in
page download time (1 ms better), but a 23% decline in average server
response time (100 ms worse). We saw no benefit in static assets, because
CloudFront handles gzip compression and ignores brotli.

Antony adjusted to compression level 5
([Kuma PR 4712](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4712)), which a
[State of Brotli article](https://samsaffron.com/archive/2016/06/15/the-current-state-of-brotli-compression)
tested to be comparable to gzip 9 in compression time but still results in
smaller assets. When this went live on March 26, we saw similar results,
with our response time returning to pre-brotli levels, but with a slight
improvement in HTML size when <code>br</code> was used.

![brotli](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-03-brotli.png
 "Effect of brotli level 11 and 5 on average response time")

When we ship CloudFront in April, the CDN will take care of compression, and
brotli will go away again. It looks like a promising technology, but requires
a CDN that supports it, and works best with a "pre-compress" workflow rather
than a "when requested" middleware workflow, which means it won't be a good
fit for MDN for a while.

Planned for April
===
We'll be busy in April with the output of the Hack on MDN event, reviewing PRs
and turning prototypes into production code. We'll continue working on our
other projects as well.

<a name="ie-mar-18">Get HTML interactive examples ready for production</a>
---
The interactive examples are transitioning from rapid experimentation to a
shipping feature. Will Bamberg published
[Bringing interactive examples to MDN](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/bringing-interactive-examples-to-mdn/)
in March, which details how this project went from idea to implementation.

The interactive examples team will firm up the code and processes, to build
a better foundation for contributors and for future support. At the same time,
they will firm up the design for HTML examples, which often require a mix of
CSS and HTML to illustrate usage.

<a name="cdn-mar-18">Ship the CDN and Django 1.11</a>
---
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) finished up caching headers for
the 60 or so MDN endpoints, and he and
[Dave Parfitt](https://github.com/metadave) added
[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) in front of the staging site.
We'll spend some time with automated and manual testing, and then reconfigure
production to also be behind a CDN.

We've missed the April 1 deadline for the Django 1.11 update. We plan to
focus on the minimum tasks needed to update in April, and will defer other
tasks, like updating out-of-date but compatible 3rd-party libraries, until
later.

This will clear our inbox so we can tackle what looks like the focus of
the rest of 2018 - migrating MDN from Marketing Engineering and Operations
(MozMEAO) to Emerging Technologies. We're losing the support of the MozMEAO
SREs Dave and [Josh Mize](https://github.com/jgmize), and ET has no operations
group, so Ryan and I will need to split up SRE duties and understand our
operations on a deeper level. To reduce risk, we're focusing on duplicating
operations in ET, rather than experimenting with new tech such as
[Google Cloud Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform).

<a name="frontend-mar-18">Improve the Front End Developer Experience</a>
---
Schalk Neethling has had some time to get familiar with the front-end code of
MDN, using tools like
[Chrome devtools’ performance and network panels](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/)
and
[Sonarwhal](https://sonarwhal.com/) to find performance issues. He's put
together a list of changes that he think will improve development and
performance.

One quick win is to replace
[FontAwesome's](https://fontawesome.com/)
custom font face with
[SVG icons](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js).
Instead of loading all the icons in a single file, only the icons used by a
page will be loaded. The SVG will be included in the HTML, avoiding additional
HTTP requests. SVG icons are automatically scaled, so they will look good on
all devices. This should also improve the development experience. It's easy to
make mistakes when using character encodings like ``"\f108\0020\eae6"``, and
much clearer to use names like ``"icon-ie icon-mobile"``.

Schalk is thinking about other challenges to front-end development, and how to
bring in current tools and techniques. He's cleaning up code to make it more
consistent, and formalizing the rules in 
[MDN Fiori](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-fiori),
a front-end style guide and pattern library. This may be the first steps to
switching to a UI component structure, such as [React](https://reactjs.org/).

A bigger improvement would be updating the front-end build pipeline. MDN's
build system was developed years ago (by Python developers) when JavaScript was
less mature, and hasn't kept up.
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is widely used to bundle code and
assets for deployment, and a new pipeline could allow developers to use a wide
ecosystem of tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to write modern
JavaScript.

Finally, we continue to look for the right way to test JavaScript.  We're
currently using
[Selenium](https://docs.seleniumhq.org/) to automate testing in a browser
environment. We've had
[issues](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4195) getting a stable set
of tools for consistent Selenium testing, and it has proven to be too heavy for
unit testing of JavaScript. Schalk has had good experiences with 
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), and wants to start testing MDN
Javascript with Jest in April.
