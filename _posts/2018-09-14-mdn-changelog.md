<a name="bcd-aug-18">Migrated 95% of compatibility data</a>
---
The MDN content team prioritized reviewing and merging Browser Compat Data
pull requests in August, and met their goal of getting the 
[open PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls) to less than 50.
The team reviewed and merged
[85 PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+created%3A%22%3C2018-08-01%22+merged%3A%222018-08-01..2018-08-31%22+)
that were open at the start of the month,
including a schema change to catch duplicate identifiers
([PR 1415](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/1415))
from
[Dominique Hazael-Massieux](https://github.com/dontcallmedom).
The team also merged
[123 PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+created%3A%22%3E%3D2018-08-01%22+merged%3A%222018-08-01..2018-08-31%22+)
that were opened during the month, including
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) configurations
for BCD editing
([PR 2498](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/2498))
from [ExE Boss](https://github.com/ExE-Boss).

A lot of these were migration PRs, and the migration is now 95% complete,
with 10,000 features over 6,300 MDN pages.  Some of the remaining migration work
will be straightforward. Other data sources will require strategy and format
discussions, such as
[Event support](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/935) and
[summary pages](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/650). These
discussions will be easier with the experience of migrating thousands of
simpler features.

We also saw several maintenance PRs this month. Contributors fixed incorrect
data, clarified if and when a browser supported a feature, and celebrated
support in new browser releases. We expect a steady stream of maintenance
PRs as the project transitions from migration to ongoing maintenance.

[Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3) has worked to make this a
community project, organizing the effort with
[spreadsheets](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/731) and
transitioning to
[issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/2684) as the
remaining work becomes manageable. This has been a successful effort, and
[GitHub insights](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulse/monthly)
shows most contributions this month were not from MDN staff:

[Tim Kadlec](https://github.com/tkadlec)
audited MDN in July, and created
[performance metrics and goals](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-fiori/wiki),
as well as
[recommending changes](https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/252).
In August, we started implementing these changes.
[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) improved the load time
for the homepage by optimizing the hero image
([PR 4903](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4903)) and removing a
section with an image
([PR 4912](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4912)).
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) automated recording
deployments and re-calculating metrics with
[Speedcurve](https://speedcurve.com/)
([PR 4902](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4902)). We'll continue
working on performance in the coming months.

Previously, if you wanted to link to a section in a page, such as MDN's advice on
[why you should use labels for `<input>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Why_you_should_use_labels),
you had to use the Developer Tools to get the section ID.
Schalk added section-level anchor links
([PR 4901](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4901)), so that you can quickly
grab the link and paste it into a code review:

[Anthony Maton](https://github.com/MatonAnthony) is switching Kuma to Python 3.
Our [memcached library](https://github.com/jezdez/django-memcached-hashring)
hasn't been updated for Python 3, and instead of a library swap, Anthony
simplified the caching configuration and switched to Redis
([PR 4870](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4870)). He continues to
make incremental changes
([PR 4899](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4899)) to get to a shared
Python 2 / Python 3 codebase, with a goal of switching to Python 3 by the end
of the year.

I completed the ElasticSearch 5.6 update, which was harder than expected.
The update from 1.7 to 2.4 only required updating the servers
([PR 4192](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4192)), and didn't even
merit a mention in the
[April 2017 report](https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2017/05/02/kuma-report/).
ElasticSearch no longer provides libraries that span major versions.
The upgrade from 2.5 to 5.6 required updating the client libraries, the
Kuma code that uses them
([PR 4906](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4906)),
and the server
([PR 4904](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4904)), all at the same time.
This update included some minor fixes, and search with 5.x appears faster, but site
search still needs a lot of work.  The next update, to ElasticSearch 6.x, will
be in March 2019.

[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone) is continuing the work of
migrating from
[MozMEAO](https://github.com/mozmeao) to Mozilla IT support.
[Ed Lim](https://github.com/limed) provisioned the new Kubernetes cluster
([PR 24](https://github.com/mdn/infra/pull/31)) and backing services
([PR 31](https://github.com/mdn/infra/pull/31)), with support from
[Dave Parfitt](https://github.com/metadave) and
[Josh Mize](https://github.com/jgmize). Ryan configured the
new Jenkins server to run parallel tests and deployments
([PR 4931](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4931)),
and to publish Docker images to a
[new repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/mdnwebdocs/)
([PR 4933](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4933)). We're now deploying to
both the [MozMEAO staging environment](https://developer.allizom.org/en-US/)
and the
[MozIT staging environment](https://developer-stage.mdn.mozit.cloud/en-US/).


We'll continue with production and disaster-recovery environments in
September, and prioritize the
[infrastructure issues](https://github.com/mdn/infra). Our goal is to switch
production traffic in October.

Planned for September
===
In September, we'll continue working on new and improved interactive examples,
converting compatibility data, migrating MDN services, and other long-term
projects.

<a name="accessibility-aug-18">Hack on Accessibility</a>
---
We're happy with the results of the
[Paris Hack on MDN event](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/hack-on-mdn-building-useful-tools-with-browser-compatibility-data/)
in March, and are doing it again in September. MDN staff will meet in London
for a week of meetings and 2019 planning, and then have the fourth
[Hack on MDN event](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Hack_on_MDN), focusing on
Accessibility.  We plan to write docs, build tools, and explore ways to help
web developers make the internet more accessible for all users.

<a name="perf-aug-18">Ship more performance improvements</a>
---
We'll continue working on the suggested performance improvements, to meet
the [performance goals](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-fiori/wiki) for the year.

One area for improvement is optimizing MDN's use of custom web fonts. These
fonts often need to be downloaded, increasing page load time. Some plugins
and clients, like
[Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/),
improve the mobile experience by blocking these by default. Our goal is to
improve the experience for desktop users by downloading optimized fonts after
the initial page load, and avoiding required custom fonts like FontAwesome for
icons.

Another focus is Interactive Examples, which are useful but have a large
impact on page load time.
[James Hobin](https://github.com/hobinjk) is working through the requirements
to
[load the examples directly into the page](https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/264),
rather than via an ``<iframe>``. Schalk is improving the
[asset builder](https://github.com/mdn/bob) for new features and for
optimized asset building.
