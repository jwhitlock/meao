## Current work

### Frankfurt Kubernetes cluster provisioning

[We're provisioning](https://github.com/mozmar/infra/issues/293) a new Kubernetes 1.6.4 cluster in Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`). This cluster takes advantage of features in new versions of [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), [helm](https://helm.sh/), and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

We've modified our [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), and [mig](https://github.com/mozilla/mig) [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) with [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#taints-and-tolerations-beta-feature) so we can gather system metrics from both K8s master and worker nodes.

The first apps to be installed in this cluster will be [bedrock](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock) and [basket](https://github.com/mozmar/basket/).

### Basket move to Kubernetes

Basket [has been moved](https://github.com/mozmar/infra/issues/179) to Kubernetes! We experienced some networking issues in our Virginia Kubernetes cluster, so traffic has been routed away from this cluster for the time being.

### Snippets

The Firefox 56 activity stream will ship to some users, with some form of snippets integration.
