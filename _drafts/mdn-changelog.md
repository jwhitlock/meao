title: MDN Changelog for December 2018
author: John Whitlock
---

December is when Mozilla meets as a company for the All-Hands, and we reflect
on the past year and plan for the future. Here are some of the highlights of
2018.

The [browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) (BCD) project
required a sustained effort to convert MDN's documentation to
structured data.  The conversion was 39% complete at the start of 2018, and
ended at 98%.  [Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3) coordinated a
large community of staff and volunteers, breaking up the work into human-sized
chunks that could be done in parallel. The community converted, verified, and
refreshed the data, and converted thousands of MDN pages to use the new data
sources. Volunteers also built tools and integrations on top of the data.

The [interactive-examples project](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/)
had a great year as well. [Will Bamberg](https://github.com/wbamberg)
coordinated the work, including some all-staff efforts to write new examples.
[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) improved the platform
as it grew to handle CSS, JavaScript, and HTML examples.

In 2018 the developers moved from MozMEAO to Developer Outreach, joining the
content staff in Emerging Technologies. The organizational change in March was
followed by a nine-month effort to move the servers to the new ET account.
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone),
[Ed Lim](https://github.com/limed), and
[Dave Parfitt](https://github.com/metadave) completed the smoothest server
transition in MDN's history.

The strength of MDN is our documentation of fundamental web technologies.
Under the leadership of [Chris Mills](https://github.com/chrisdavidmills),
this content was maintained, improved, and expanded in 2018. It's a lot of work
to keep an institution running and growing, and there are few opportunities to
properly celebrate that work. Thanks to
[Daniel Beck](https://github.com/ddbeck/),
[Eric Shepherd](https://github.com/a2sheppy),
[Estelle Weyl](https://github.com/estelle),
[Irene Smith](https://github.com/irenesmith),
[Janet Swisher](https://github.com/jmswisher),
[Rachel Andrew](https://github.com/rachelandrew),
and our community of partners and volunteers for keeping MDN awesome in 2018.

[Kadir Topal](https://github.com/atopal) led the rapid development of the
[payments project](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/payments/). We're
grateful to all the MDN readers who are supporting the maintenance and growth
of MDN.

Planned for January
===

[David Flanagan](https://github.com/davidflanagan) took a look at
[KumaScript](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript), MDN's macro rendering engine,
and is proposing several changes to modernize it, including using
[await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
and
[Jest](https://jestjs.io). These changes are performing well in the development
environment, and we plan to get the new code in production in January.
