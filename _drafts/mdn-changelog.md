<a name="bcd-may-18">Migrated CSS @media and MathML compat data</a>
---
The browser compatibility migration continued, jumping from 72% to 80%
complete.
[Daniel D. Beck](https://github.com/ddbeck) completed the
[CSS @media rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media)
features, by converting data
([PR 2087](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/2087) and a
half-dozen others) and by reviewing PRs
like [1977](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/1977)
from
[Nathan Cook](https://github.com/nathancharles).
[Mark Boas](https://github.com/maboa) finished up
[MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML), submitting
[26 pull requests](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+merged%3A2018-05-01..2018-05-31+author%3Amaboa+label%3A%22data%3Amathml+%3Aheavy_division_sign%3A%22).

![at-media](

 "The @media table has 32 features. It's a big one.")

There are over 8500 features in the BCD dataset, and half of the remaining work
is already submitted as pull requests. We're making steady progress toward
completing the migration effort.


<a name="django-1-11-may-18">Prepared for Django 1.11</a>
---
MDN runs on Django 1.8, the second long-term support (LTS) release. In May, we
updated the code so that MDN's test suite and core processes work on Django
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11.  We didn't make it by the end of May, but by the time
this report is published, we'll be on Django 1.11 in production.

Many Mozilla web projects use Django, and most stick to the LTS releases.
In 2015, the MDN team upgraded from Django 1.4 LTS to 1.7 in
[PR 3073](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/3073/), which weighed in at 223
commits, 12,000 files, 1.2 million lines of code, and at least six months of
effort.  Django 1.8 followed six months later in
[PR 3525](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/3525), a lighter change of 30
commits, 2,600 files, and 250,000 lines of code. After this effort, the team
was happy to stick with 1.8 for a while.

Most of the upgrade pain was specific to Kuma. The massive file counts were due
to importing libraries as
[git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules),
a common practice at the time for security, reliability, and customization. It
was also harder to update libraries, which meant updates were often delayed until
necessary. The 1.7 upgrade included an update from Python 2.6 to 2.7, and it is
challenging to support dual-Python installs on a single web server.

The MDN team worked within some of these constraints, and tackled others. They
re-implemented the development VM setup scripts in
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), but kept
[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) for production. They updated submodules for
the 1.7 effort, and switched to hashed requirements files for 1.8. A lot of
codebase and process improvements were gained during the update effort. Other
improvements, such as Dockerized environments, were added later to avoid issues
in the next big update.

[Django 1.4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.4/)
wasn't originally planned as an LTS release, but instead was
[scheduled for retirement](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.5/#python-compatibility)
after the
[1.6 release](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.6/).
The end of support was repeatedly pushed further into the future, finally
extending to
[six months after 1.8 was published](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-developers/W1sMVXwh8TU).

On the other hand, the Django team knew that
[1.8 was an LTS release](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.8/)
when they shipped it, and would get security updates for three years. Many of
the Django team's decisions in 2015 made MDN's update easier. Django 1.11
retained Python 2.7 support, avoiding the pain of a simultaneous Python
upgrade. Django now has a
[predictable release process](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/release-process/),
which is great for website and library maintainers.

![django-release-roadmap](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-05-django-release-roadmap.png
 "Django's release roadmap makes scheduling update efforts much easier.")

Django also maintains
[a guide on updating Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/upgrade-version/),
and the suggested process worked well for us.

The
[first step](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/upgrade-version/#dependencies)
was to upgrade third-party libraries, which we've been working on for the past
two years.  My goal was to get a library update into most production pushes,
and we updated dozens of libraries while shipping unrelated features.  Some
libraries, such as
[django-pipeline](https://github.com/jazzband/django-pipeline/pull/629),
didn't support Django 1.11, so we had to update them ourselves.
In other cases, like
[django-tidings](https://github.com/mozilla/django-tidings/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed),
we also had to take over project maintenance for a while.

The
[next step](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/upgrade-version/#resolving-deprecation-warnings)
was to turn on Django's deprecation warnings, to find the known
update issues. This highlighted a few more libraries to update, and also the
big changes needed in our code. One problem area was our language-prefixed URLs.
MDN uses Mozilla-standard language codes, such as `/en-US/`, where the region
is in capital letters. Django ships a
[locale-prefixed URL framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#module-django.conf.urls.i18n),
but uses lowercase language codes, such as `/en-us/`. Mozilla's custom
framework broke in 1.9, and we tried a few approaches before copying Django's
framework and making adjustments for Mozilla-style language codes
([PR 4790](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4790)).

Next we 
[ran our automated tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/upgrade-version/#testing),
and started fixing the many failures. Our goal was to support multiple Django
versions in a single codebase, and we added optional builds to TravisCI to run
tests on 1.9, 1.10, and 1.11
([PR 4806](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4806)).
We split the fixes into over 50 pull requests, and tested small batches of
changes by deploying to production. In some cases, the same code works across
all four versions. In other cases, we switched between code paths
[based on the Django version](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4807/commits/067382bc01c44627256fd1648ff4526ee196d870).
Updates for Django 1.9 were about 90% of the upgrade effort.

This incremental approach is safer than a massive PR, and avoids issues with
keeping a long-running branch up to date. It does make it harder to estimate
the scope of a change. Looking at the commits that mention the [update
bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1401246),
we changed 2500 to 3000 lines, which represents 10% of the project code.

<a name="zenhub-may-18">Started tracking work in ZenHub</a>
---
For the past two years, the MDN team has been using
[Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/viya-mdn-durable-team/) to plan and
track our work in 3-week sprints. The team was unhappy with performance
issues, and had been experimenting with GitHub's project management features.
[Janet Swisher](https://github.com/jmswisher) and
[Eric Shepherd](https://github.com/a2sheppy) led an effort to explore
alternatives. Starting in May, we started using
[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/), which
provides a sprint planning layer on top of GitHub issues and milestones.

![zenhub](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-05-zenhub.png
 "See how the sausage gets made with our ZenHub board.")

If you have the ZenHub plugin installed, you can view the sprint board in the
new
[mdn/sprints](https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues#boards?repos=121649843,55001853,70901646,134759439,90252175,1352520,3311772,82040629,121278372,33677290,132630865)
repository, which collects tasks across our 10 active repositories. It also
adds additional data to GitHub issues and pull requests, linking them into
project planning. If you don't have the plugin, you can view the sprint board
on the [ZenHub website](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/mdn/sprints/boards).
If you don't want to sign in to ZenHub with your GitHub account, you can
view the milestones in the individual projects, like the
[Sprint 4 milestone](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/milestone/6)
in the Interactive Examples project.

<a name="ie-may-18">Continued HTML Interactive Examples</a>
---
We're still working through the technical challenges of shipping HTML
interactive examples. One of the blocking issues is restricting style
changes to the demo output on the right, but not the example code on the
left. This is a use case for
[Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM),
which can restrict styles to a subset of elements.
[Schalk Neethling](https://github.com/schalkneethling) shipped a solution
based on Shadow DOM in
[PR 873](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/873) and
[PR 927](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/927), and it works
in Chrome. Unfortunately,
[not all current browsers support Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow#Browser_compatibility),
and we've had difficulty integrating a shim. We'll continue to work on this
and other blockers.

Meanwhile, the community has written some interesting demos for
[&lt;track&gt;](https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/tabbed/track.html)
([Leonard Lee](https://github.com/sheeeng),
[PR 940](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/940)),
[&lt;map&gt;](https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/tabbed/map.html)
([Adilson Sandoval](https://github.com/2alin),
[PR 931](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/931)),
and [&lt;blockquote&gt;](https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/tabbed/blockquote.html)
([Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3),
[PR 906](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/pull/906)). We're excited
to get these and the other examples on MDN.

<a name="continue-may-18">Planned for June</a>
===
We plan to ship Django 1.11 to production in early June, before this post is
published. We'll spend some additional time in June fixing any issues that
MDN's millions of visitors discover, and upgrading the code to take advantage
of some of the new features.

We plan to keep working on the compatibility data migration, HTML interactive
examples, and other in-progress projects. June is the end of the second
quarter, and is a deadline for many quarterly goals.

We are gathering in San Francisco for
[Mozilla's All-Hands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/SanFrancisco2018).
It will be a chance for the remote team to be in the same room, to celebrate
the year's accomplishments, and to make plans for the rest of the year.
