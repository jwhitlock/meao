Done in November
===

<a name="payments-nov-18">Shipped monthly MDN payments</a>
---
In September we
[launched MDN payments](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/payments-accessibility-and-dead-macros-mdn-changelog-for-september-2018/#launched-mdn-payments),
giving MDN fans 
[a new way to help MDN grow](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/a-new-way-to-support-mdn/).
On November 20th, we added the ability to
[schedule monthly payments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/payments/recurring).

![monthly-banner](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-12-monthly-payments.png
 "Monthly payment page on MDN")

[Potato London](https://p.ota.to/) started work on this shortly after
one-time payments launched. We kicked it off with a design meeting where we
determined the features that could be delivered in 4 weeks.  Potato and MDN
worked closely to remove blockers, review code (in over 25 pull requests), and
get it into the staging environment for testing.  Thanks to everyone's hard
work, we launched a high-quality feature on schedule.

We've learned a lot from these payment experiments, and we'll continue to find
ways to maintain MDN's growth in 2019.

<a name="svg-nov-18">Converted from Font Awesome to SVG</a>
---
On November 6th, we deployed
[Schalk Neethling's](https://github.com/schalkneethling)
[PR 5058](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5058), completing the transition
from the FontAwesome webfont to inline SVG icons. There are a few icon and
style changes, but the site should look the same to most users.


![indicators](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-12-indicators.png
 "Banners with icons from Font Awesome (left) versus SVG")

We had
[several reasons](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1451261#c0)
for this change in April, when Schalk started the project. The biggest gains
were expected to be in performance and a simpler design. Over the year, we
became aware that many content blockers prevent loading web fonts, and many
users couldn't see UIs that depended on icons.
For example, the browser compatibility tables [were unusable on
mobile](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1480106) with
[Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/).
This change fixes this issue.

We haven't seen a significant performance improvement, although there may have
been small improvements as this switch was rolled out over the year. This
month, we explored some more radical changes, such as minimal styling and
disabled JS, by shipping manually edited copies of wiki pages. These
experiments will help us determine the highest impact changes for front-end
performance, and provide insight into what areas to explore next.

<a name="bcd-nov-18">Added browser names to compatibility tables</a>
---
The new SVG icons are being used in the browser compatibility table. In the
wider desktop view, we've added rotated browser labels
([Kuma PR 5117](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5117) and
[KumaScript PR 997](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/997)),
so it is clearer which browser is which. We also launched a survey to ask
visitors about their needs for compatibility data
([Kuma PR 5133](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5133)).

![bcd-labels](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-12-bcd-labels.png
 "Browser compatibility table with rotate labels and survey")

The compatibility data continues to be released as 
[an NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data), and now
[a tagged release](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases) is also
created, including the statistics and notable changes from the last
release.
([BCD PR 3158](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/3158)).

Planned for December
===

<a name="all-hands-nov-18">Meet in Orlando</a>
---
Twice a year, all of Mozilla comes together for an All-Hands meeting.
This winter's All-Hands is in
[Orlando, Florida](https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/Orlando2018). We were
in Orlando in December 2015, when Florian was proposing
[moving KumaScript macros to GitHub](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.mdn/PEuH7WW2Xtk)
and I was deploying the
[BrowserCompat API](https://github.com/mdn/browsercompat/blob/master/HISTORY.rst)
to beta users. A lot changes in three years!

Many of us at MDN will be taking well-deserved breaks after the All-Hands, and
will come back refreshed for 2019. We hope you and yours have an enjoyable
winter break!
