title: MDN Changelog for October 2018
author: John Whitlock
---

Here's what happened in October to the
[code, data, and tools](https://github.com/mdn/)
that support
[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org):

- [Shipped performance improvements](#perf-oct-18)
- [Moved MDN to MozIT](#mozit-oct-18)
- [Shipped tweaks and fixes](#tweaks-oct-18)
  by merging 352 pull requests,
  including 78 pull requests
  from 62 new contributors.

Here's the plan for November:

- [Ship recurring payments](#recurring-oct-18)

Done in October

We shipped some changes designed to improve MDN's page load time. The effects
were not as large as we hoped.

Our sidebars, like the Related Topics sidebar on
[&lt;summary&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary),
use a "mozToggler" JavaScript method to implement open and collapsed sections.
This uses [jQueryUI's toggle effect](https://jqueryui.com/toggle/), and is
applied dynamically at load time.
[Tim Kadlec](https://github.com/tkadlec) replaced it with the
[&lt;details&gt; element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
([KumaScript PR 789](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/pull/789) and
[Kuma PR 4957](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4957)),
which semantically models open and collapsed sections. The `<details>` element
is supported by most current browsers, with the notable exception of
Microsoft Edge, which is supported with a polyfill.

![moztoggler](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-11-moztoggler.png
 "We expected at least 150ms improvement based on bench tests.")

The `<details>` update shipped October 4th, and the 31,000 pages
with sidebars were regenerated to apply the change.

A second change was to reduce the use of
[Web Fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Web_fonts),
which must be downloaded and can cause the page to be repainted. Some browsers,
such as [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/), block
web fonts by default for performance and to save bandwidth.

One strategy is to eliminate the web font entirely. We replaced
[OpenSans](https://www.opensans.com/) with the built-in Verdana as the body
font in September
([PR 4967](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4967)), and then again with
Arial on October 22
([PR 5023](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5023)). We're also replacing
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), implemented with a web font,
with inline SVG
([PR 4969](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/4969) and
[PR 5053](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5053)). We expect to complete
the SVG work in November.

A second strategy is to reduce the size of the web font. The custom Zilla font,
introduced with the
[June 2017](https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2017/07/06/kuma-report/) redesign,
was reduced to standard English characters, cutting the file sizes in half
on October 10
([PR 5024](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma/pull/5024)).

These changes had an impact on total download size and rendering time, and
we're seeing improvements in our
[synthetic metrics](https://speedcurve.com/features/synthetic/).
However, there was
[no significant change in page load](https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/258#issuecomment-428225500)
as measured for MDN users.  In November, we'll try some more radical
experiments to learn more about the components of page load time.

![speedcurve](
 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-11-speedcurve.png
 "Synthetic measurements show steady improvement, but not yet on target.")

<a name="mozit-oct-18">Moved MDN to MozIT</a>
---
[Ryan Johnson](https://github.com/escattone),
[Ed Lim](https://github.com/limed), and
[Dave Parfitt](https://github.com/metadave)
switched production traffic from the Marketing to the IT servers on October 29th.
The site was placed in read-only mode, so all the content was available during
the transition. There were some small hiccups, mostly around running out of API
budge for [Amazon's Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (EFS),
but we handled the issues within in the maintenance window.

 {{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/kuma/2018-11-maisenbacher.jpg
 "[Maisenbacher House Moving 8](https://flic.kr/p/5Ce1hR) by Katherine Johnson, [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)")

In the weeks leading up to the cut over, the team tested deployments,
updated documentation, and checked data transfer processes. They created a list
of tasks and assignments, detailed the process for the migration, and planned the
cleanup work after the cut over. The team's attention to detail and continuous
communication made this a smooth transition for MDN's users, with no downtime
or bugs.

The MozIT cluster is very similar to the previous MozMEAO cluster. The
[technical overview](https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2017/11/07/kuma-report/#aws-intro)
from the October 10, 2017 launch is still a decent guide to how MDN is deployed.

There are a handful of changes, most of which MDN users shouldn't notice.
We're now hosting images in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mdnwebdocs/)
rather than [quay.io](https://quay.io/).
The MozMEAO cluster ran Kubernetes 1.7, and the new MozIT cluster runs 1.9.
This may be responsible for more reliable DNS lookups, avoiding occasional
failures connecting to the database or other AWS services.

In November, we'll continue monitoring the new servers, and shut down the
redundant services in the MozMEAO account. We'll then re-evaluate our plans from
the beginning of the year, and prioritize the next infrastructure updates.
The top of the list is reliable acceptance tests and deploys across multiple
AWS zones.

Planned for November
===
We'll continue on performance experiments in November, such as removing
Font Awesome and looking for new ways to lower page load time. We'll continue
ongoing projects, such as migrating and updating browser compatibility data
and shipping more HTML examples like the one on
[&lt;input&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input).

<a name="recurring-oct-18">Ship recurring payments</a>
---
In October, we shipped
[a new way to support MDN](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/a-new-way-to-support-mdn/)
with one-time payments. For November, we're working with
[Potato London](https://p.ota.to/) again to add the option for
monthly payments to MDN.
